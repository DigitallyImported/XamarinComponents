# YouTube Player for iOS

The YouTube Player for iOS is an open source library that helps you embed a YouTube iframe player into an iOS application. The library creates a `UIWebView` and a bridge between your application’s C# code and the YouTube player’s JavaScript code, thereby allowing the iOS application to control the YouTube player.
